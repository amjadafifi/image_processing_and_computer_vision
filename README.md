# image_processing_tasks
Image Processing, Advanced Media Lab (Semester 10) and Computer Vision Tasks. Semesters 9 and 10

This is a collection of Image Processing and Computer Vision tasks and mini-projects that tackle different areas and algorithms. 
Algorithms in Computer Vision include but are not limited to calculating Integral Image and Local Sum Calculation, Kernel Convolution, and applying several filters. 
Algorithms in Image Processing include but are not limited to distance transform algorithm, SIFT algorithm, and shadow detection and reduction. 
They are done in Python and MATLAB.

All work done is original work using the help of Google and websites such as Stack Overflow etc.
